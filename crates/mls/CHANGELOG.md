## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/compare/slim-mls-v0.4.2...slim-mls-v0.4.3) - 2026-10-06

### Other

- updated the following local packages: agntcy-slim-version, agntcy-slim-auth

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/compare/slim-mls-v0.4.1...slim-mls-v0.4.2) - 2026-09-30

### Other

- updated the following local packages: agntcy-slim-auth

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/compare/slim-mls-v0.4.0...slim-mls-v0.4.1) - 2026-09-30

### Other

- updated the following local packages: agntcy-slim-version, agntcy-slim-auth

## [0.4.0] - semver correction

`0.3.11` moved to the `mls-rs` 0.56 / `mls-rs-core` 0.27 line as a **patch**
release, and required `agntcy-slim-persistence = "^0.1.0"` — which admits
`0.1.1`, also incorrectly patch-bumped onto the same new line (see that
crate's changelog). Combined with a consumer held on `agntcy-slim-auth
0.15.x` (which pins the 0.54 line), a fresh resolve could select `slim-mls
0.3.10` (0.54) together with `slim-persistence 0.1.1` (0.56) in the same
graph and fail to build. See [#2142](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/issues/2142).

This release has no code changes from `0.3.11` beyond requiring
`agntcy-slim-persistence = "^0.2.0"` — it exists so the version number
correctly signals the breaking dependency change that `0.3.11` should have
carried.
